# One a Day

A quick and dirty static site for hosting a "one picture a day" project. I know, far from original.

Used Chat GPT as a starting point for some of the code. I'll leave it to the reader to judge whether what it created is better or worse than what I would have done with my normal stackoverflow => trial & error workflow.
