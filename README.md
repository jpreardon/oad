# One a Day

*Photoblogging like it's 1996*

This quick and dirty static site for hosting [this "one picture a day" project](https://jpreardon.com/oad/). I know, far from original.

No databases, no javascript, no frameworks. Just some very, very basic code.

I used Chat GPT as a starting point for the python code. I'll leave it to the reader to judge whether what it created is better or worse than what I would have done with my normal, trial & error workflow.
